Multimodal Instruction-following Agents. In computer vision, existing works that build instruction- following agents can be broadly categorized into two classes: (i) End-to-end trained models, which are separately explored for each speciﬁc research topic. For example, the vision-language navigation task [3, 19] and Habitat [47] require the embodied AI agent to follow natural language instructions and take a sequence of actions to complete goals in visual environments. In the image editing domain, given an input image and a written instruction that tells the agent what to do, InstructPix2Pix [6] edits images by following the human instructions. (ii) A system that coordinates various models via LangChain [1] / LLMs [35], such as Visual ChatGPT [53], X-GPT [63], MM-REACT [55], VisProg [18], and ViperGPT [46]. While sharing the same goal in building instruction-following agents, we focus on developing an end-to-end trained language-vision multimodal model for multiple tasks.

Instruction Tuning. In the natural language processing (NLP) community, to enable LLMs such as GPT-3 [7], T5 [41], PaLM [10], and OPT [60] to follow natural language instructions and complete real-world tasks, researchers have explored methods for LLM instruction-tuning [37, 52, 51], leading to instruction-tuned counterparts such as InstructGPT [37]/ChatGPT [35], FLAN-T5 [11], FLAN-PaLM [11], and OPT-IML [22], respectively. It turns out that this simple approach can effectively improve the zero- and few-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. It is thus natural to borrow the idea from NLP to computer vision. More broadly, the teacher-student distillation ideas with foundation models have been studied in other topics such as image classiﬁcation [14]. Flamingo [2] can be viewed as the GPT-3 moment in the multimodal domain, due to its strong performance on zero-shot task transfer and in-context-learning. Other LMMs trained on image- text pairs include BLIP-2 [28], FROMAGe [24], and KOSMOS-1 [20]. PaLM-E [13] is an LMM for embodied AI. Based on the recent “best” open-source LLM LLaMA, OpenFlamingo [5] and LLaMA-Adapter [59] are open-source efforts that enable LLaMA to use image inputs, paving the way to build open-source multimodal LLMs. While these models present promising task transfer generalization performance, they are not explicitly tuned with vision-language instruction data, and their performance in multimodal tasks usually falls short compared to language-only tasks. In this paper, we aim to ﬁll this gap and study its effectiveness. Finally, note that visual instruction tuning is different from visual prompt tuning [23]: the former aims to improve the model’s instruction- following abilities, while the latter aims to improve the parameter-efﬁciency in model adaptation.
