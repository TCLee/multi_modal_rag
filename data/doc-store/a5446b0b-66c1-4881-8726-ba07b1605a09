Table 4: Ablation on LLaVA-Bench (COCO) with different training data. We report relative scores w.r.t. a text-only GPT-4 model that uses ground truth image captions and bounding boxes as visual input. We prompt GPT-4 with the answers from our model outputs and the answers by GPT-4 (text-only), and let it compare between both responses and give a rating with an explanation.
