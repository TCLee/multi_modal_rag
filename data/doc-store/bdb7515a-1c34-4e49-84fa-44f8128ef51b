Annotation A close-up photo of a meal at ICHI- RAN. The chashu ramen bowl with a spoon is placed in the center. The ramen is seasoned with chili sauce, chopped scallions, and served with two pieces of chashu. Chopsticks are placed to the right of the bowl, still in their paper wrap, not yet opened. The ramen is also served with nori on the left. On top, from left to right, the fol- lowing sides are served: a bowl of or- ange spice (possibly garlic sauce), a plate of smoke-ﬂavored stewed pork with chopped scallions, and a cup of matcha green tea.
