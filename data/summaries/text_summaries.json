    "LLaVA is a large multimodal model that combines a vision encoder and an LLM for visual and language understanding. It was trained using language-only GPT-4 generated multimodal language-image instruction-following data. LLaVA demonstrates impressive multimodal chat abilities and achieves a 85.1% relative score compared with GPT-4 on a synthetic multimodal instruction-following dataset. When fine-tuned on Science QA, LLaVA achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.53%. The model, code, and GPT-4 generated visual instruction tuning data are publicly available. \n",
    "This paper introduces visual instruction-tuning, a novel approach to building a general-purpose visual assistant. It addresses the lack of vision-language instruction-following data by converting image-text pairs into an instruction-following format using ChatGPT/GPT-4. The paper also presents a large multimodal model (LMM) by connecting CLIP's visual encoder with Vicuna's language decoder and fine-tuning it on the generated data. The LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Science QA dataset when combined with GPT-4. Additionally, the paper introduces LLaVA-Bench, a multimodal instruction-following benchmark with challenging tasks, and releases the generated data, codebase, model checkpoints, and a visual chat demo. \n",
    "This section discusses related work in the field of multimodal instruction-following agents, focusing on two main approaches: end-to-end trained models and systems that coordinate various models via LangChain or LLMs. It also explores the concept of instruction tuning in natural language processing (NLP) and its application to computer vision. The section highlights the limitations of existing multimodal models, particularly their lack of explicit tuning with vision-language instruction data, and emphasizes the need for further research in this area. \n",
    "This paper proposes a method for generating visual instruction-following data using GPT-4. The method leverages existing image-text pairs and prompts GPT-4 to generate questions about the image. These questions are then used to instruct GPT-4 to describe the image content, resulting in instruction-following data. The paper also explores using symbolic representations, such as captions and bounding boxes, to encode images into text-based formats that can be processed by GPT-4. Three types of instruction-following data are generated: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The paper highlights the limitations of existing methods for generating instruction-following data and proposes a more efficient and scalable approach using GPT-4. \n",
    "This paper describes a dataset of 158K language-image instruction-following samples for training visual instruction-following models. The dataset is divided into three categories: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The conversation category includes questions about the visual content of an image, such as object types, counting objects, object actions, object locations, and relative positions between objects. The detailed description category includes questions that require a rich and comprehensive description of the image. The complex reasoning category includes questions that require a step-by-step reasoning process by following rigorous logic. The paper also describes the architecture of the visual instruction-following model, which uses Vicuna as the LLM and a visual model. \n",

    "## LLaVA Network Architecture and Training:\n\nThis document describes the LLaVA network architecture, which uses a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder to generate visual features from input images. These features are then projected into the word embedding space using a linear layer. The document also outlines the training process, which involves generating multi-turn conversation data and using instruction-tuning to predict the target answers. The training objective is to maximize the probability of the target answers given the input image and instructions. \n",
    "This document describes the training process for LLaVA, a multimodal language model. The training process involves two stages: pre-training for feature alignment and fine-tuning end-to-end. The pre-training stage uses a filtered subset of CC3M image-text pairs to align image features with the pre-trained LLM word embedding. The fine-tuning stage updates both the projection layer and LLM weights on a dataset of 158K language-image instruction-following data. The model is evaluated on two tasks: multimodal chatbot and ScienceQA. \n",
    "This table describes a multimodal chatbot demo using LLaVA, a model that combines image understanding and conversation abilities. The demo uses examples from the GPT-4 paper, requiring in-depth image understanding. The table compares LLaVA's responses to those of GPT-4, BLIP-2, and OpenFlamingo on a specific image of a man ironing clothes on a moving vehicle. The table includes the user prompts and responses from each model, highlighting the differences in their image understanding and conversation capabilities. \n",
    "LLaVA is a multimodal model that demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, even on out-of-domain images. It outperforms BLIP-2 and OpenFlamingo in answering questions about images, providing more comprehensive responses and identifying atypical aspects of the scene. LLaVA's performance is comparable to GPT-4 on visual reasoning tasks, despite being trained on a smaller dataset. A quantitative evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows LLaVA's superior instruction-following ability compared to other models. \n",

The table reports the relative scores, as well as explanations from GPT-4 comparing the model's outputs to the baseline. \n",
    "This document describes the LLaVA-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). The benchmark consists of two parts: LLaVA-Bench (COCO) and LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild). LLaVA-Bench (COCO) uses 30 images from COCO-Val-2014 with 90 questions generated using a data generation pipeline. LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild) uses 24 diverse images with 60 questions, including indoor and outdoor scenes, memes, paintings, sketches, etc. The document compares the performance of LLaVA, BLIP, and OpenFlamingo on both benchmarks. LLaVA outperforms other models on both benchmarks, achieving an impressive 81.7% performance on complex reasoning questions in LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild). The document also discusses limitations of LLaVA, including its inability to grasp complex semantics within images and its need for large knowledge coverage and multilingual understanding capability. \n",
