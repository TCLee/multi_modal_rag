    "LLaVA is a multimodal language model that combines a vision encoder and an LLM for visual and language understanding. It was trained on language-only GPT-4 generated multimodal instruction-following data. LLaVA demonstrates impressive multimodal chat abilities and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Science QA. The model, code, and GPT-4 generated data are publicly available. \n",
    "This paper introduces visual instruction-tuning, a novel approach to building a general-purpose visual assistant. It addresses the lack of vision-language instruction-following data by converting image-text pairs into an instruction-following format using ChatGPT/GPT-4. The paper also presents a large multimodal model (LMM) by connecting CLIP's visual encoder with Vicuna's language decoder and fine-tuning it on the generated data. The LMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Science QA dataset when combined with GPT-4. The paper also introduces LLaVA-Bench, a multimodal instruction-following benchmark with diverse images, instructions, and annotations. The authors release the generated data, codebase, model checkpoints, and a visual chat demo. \n",
    "This section discusses related work in two areas: multimodal instruction-following agents and instruction tuning. It contrasts end-to-end trained models with systems that coordinate various models via LangChain or LLMs. It also highlights the effectiveness of instruction tuning in NLP and its potential application to computer vision. The section mentions various models, including Flamingo, BLIP-2, FROMAGe, KOSMOS-1, PaLM-E, OpenFlamingo, and LLaMA-Adapter, and discusses their strengths and limitations. Finally, it differentiates visual instruction tuning from visual prompt tuning. \n",
    "This paper proposes a method for generating multimodal instruction-following data using GPT-4. The method leverages existing image-text pairs and prompts GPT-4 to generate questions about the image content. The authors use two types of symbolic representations to encode the image into text: captions and bounding boxes. They generate three types of instruction-following data: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The paper highlights the limitations of existing multimodal instruction-following data and proposes a solution using GPT-4 to address these limitations. \n",
    "This paper describes a dataset of 158K language-image instruction-following samples for training visual instruction-following models. The dataset is divided into three categories: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The conversation category includes questions about the visual content of an image, such as object types, counting objects, object actions, object locations, and relative positions between objects. The detailed description category includes questions that require a rich and comprehensive description of the image. The complex reasoning category includes questions that require a step-by-step reasoning process by following rigorous logic. The paper also describes the architecture of the visual instruction-following model, which uses Vicuna as the LLM and a visual model. \n",

    "## LLaVA Network Architecture and Training:\n\nThis document describes the LLaVA network architecture, which uses a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder to generate visual features from input images. These features are then projected into the word embedding space using a linear layer. The document also details the training process, which involves generating multi-turn conversation data and using an instruction-tuning approach to predict the target answers. The training objective is to maximize the probability of the target answers given the input image and instructions. \n",
    "This document describes the training process for LLaVA, a multimodal language model. The training process involves two stages: pre-training for feature alignment and fine-tuning end-to-end. The pre-training stage uses a filtered subset of CC3M image-text pairs to align image features with the pre-trained LLM word embedding. The fine-tuning stage updates both the projection layer and LLM weights on a dataset of 158K language-image instruction-following data. The model is evaluated on two tasks: multimodal chatbot and ScienceQA. \n",
    "This table describes a multimodal chatbot demo using LLaVA, a model that understands images and follows instructions. The demo uses examples from the GPT-4 paper, including an image of a man ironing clothes on a moving vehicle. The table compares LLaVA's responses to the same prompts with GPT-4, BLIP-2, and OpenFlamingo. \n",
    "LLaVA is a multimodal model that demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, even on out-of-domain images. It outperforms BLIP-2 and OpenFlamingo in answering questions about images, providing more comprehensive responses and identifying atypical aspects of the scene. LLaVA's performance is comparable to GPT-4 on visual reasoning tasks, despite being trained on a smaller dataset. A quantitative evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows LLaVA's superior instruction-following ability. \n",
    "This table presents an ablation study on the LLaVA-Bench (COCO) dataset, comparing the performance of different training data configurations for a visual language model. The results are presented as relative scores compared to a text-only GPT-4 model that uses ground truth image captions and bounding boxes as visual input. The evaluation method involves prompting GPT-4 with the answers from the model outputs and the text-only GPT-4, and then having GPT-4 compare and rate the responses with an explanation. \n",
    "Table 5 compares the instruction-following capabilities of LLaVA, BLIP, and OpenFlamingo on the LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild) benchmark. LLaVA significantly outperforms the other models, achieving an overall score of 67.3% and a score of 81.7% on complex reasoning questions. The table shows the mean and standard deviation of relative scores for each model, with three inference runs for the first three rows. The results indicate that LLaVA's visual instruction tuning significantly improves its performance. \n",
