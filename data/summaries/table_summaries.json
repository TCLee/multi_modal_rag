    "This table shows the performance of a model on a conversation task, with different levels of detail and complex reasoning. The model was trained with and without instruction tuning. The results show that the model performs best with full data and instruction tuning, and that performance decreases as the amount of detail and complex reasoning increases. The model also performs worse without instruction tuning. \n",
    "This table compares the performance of four different language models (OpenFlamingo, BLIP-2, LLaVA, and LLaVA†) on four tasks: Conversation Detail description, Complex reasoning, All, and OpenFlamingo. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy scores, with higher scores indicating better performance. LLaVA and LLaVA† consistently outperform the other models across all tasks. \n",
    "This table compares the performance of different methods for a task involving natural language understanding (NAT), subject matter (SOC), local area network (LAN), and context. It includes both representative and state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, with results reported from both literature and the authors' own experiments. The table shows the accuracy scores for each method across different grade levels (G1-6, G7-12, and average), as well as the modality used (IMG for image, TXT for text, and NO for none). The methods include GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 with chain-of-thought (CoT), LLaMA-Adapter, MM-CoTBase, MM-CoTLarge, GPT-4, LLaVA, and combinations of LLaVA with GPT-4. \n",
    "This table shows the performance of different language models on a visual question answering task. The models are compared based on their accuracy, measured as the percentage of questions answered correctly. The \"Before\" column shows the accuracy of a baseline model, while the \"Last Best variant\" column shows the accuracy of the best performing model. The \"Predict answer first\" column shows the accuracy of a model that predicts the answer first, and the \"Training from scratch\" column shows the accuracy of a model that is trained from scratch. The \"7B model size\" column shows the accuracy of a model with a 7 billion parameter size. The results show that the best performing model achieves an accuracy of 89.96%, which is a significant improvement over the baseline model. \n"
